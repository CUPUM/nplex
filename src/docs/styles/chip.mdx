# Button

The button style encompasses both functional buttons and navigation buttons (links).

This style should not be used for elements where nested buttons are expected. An example case would
be a `select` element with sibling buttons: this could be implemented as a `button-group` or an
`input-group` depending on the desired outcome.

```ts
export const test = '';
```
