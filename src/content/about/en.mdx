title: Nplex presents the exemplarity of design and architecture around you
---

Our platform promoting design excellence showcases local designers and artisans of affordable and
responsible projects.

- A platform for citizens who want to learn more about best design practices in their area.
- A platform for architects, designers and planners who want to share their work.
- A platform conceived to find useful resources and competent individuals in the field of design.

Nplex lists "exemplary small design projects" conceived and realized by local professionals. From
kitchens and esplanades to gardens and balconies, Nplex highlights local excellence and provides
information on best practices for modest renovation and construction projects.

The selection of projects featured in Nplex is based on the criteria of its
[Exemplarity Guide](/en/guides): sustainability, resilience, moderation of energy consumption,
economic optimization, attractiveness and cultural enhancement, innovation, equity and
inclusiveness, and well-being.

Nplex is an initiative of the UNESCO Chair in Urban Landscape of the University of Montreal, and is
realized with the support of the Bureau du design de la Ville de Montr√©al and the Fonds Sid Lee
Architecture.
