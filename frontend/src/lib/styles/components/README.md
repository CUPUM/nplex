# Components

Style components are classes or element-specific re-usable app-wide styles. Unlike utils which are
only developpment ressources, helper styles actually end up in the app's stylesheets.

They do not hold any particular relationship with svelte components. They simply provide prepackaged
stylisations as classes.
