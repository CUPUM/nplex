# Global state management

Many states throughout the app are managed through globally accessible stores to ensure persistence across uses.

To keep things tidy, organize this directory such that each store is defined in its own file, and grouping stores by subjects of relevance or app sections can be done using name prefixes akin to the organizing principle found in component directories.
