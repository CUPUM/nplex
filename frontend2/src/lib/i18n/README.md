# Internationalization (i18n)

## Locale

A locale is an internationalization code that specifies a `language` code, and optionally a `region`
code that specifies further the format of certain linguistic features (ex.: currencies, dates,
custom region-specific messages, etc.). Locales are thus formatted as `[language]-[REGION]`, common
examples are:

- `fr`: French
- `en`: English
- `en-CA`: English (Canada)
- `de-CH`: German (Switzerland)
