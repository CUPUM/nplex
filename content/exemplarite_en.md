Assessing the exemplarity of a design project is complex. Various characteristics can contribute to its exemplarity. We have selected eight of them: sustainability, resilience, moderation of energy consumption, economic optimization, attractiveness and cultural enhancement, innovation, equity and inclusiveness, and well-being. Each project is unique, and exemplarity emerges from the coherent interaction of these aspects. 

Select all the exemplarity indicators for which the project stands out. To do this, you can refer to our [Exemplarity Guide](#lien_vers_le_guide_en). On this basis, our experts will evaluate your project so that it can be published on Nplex.
